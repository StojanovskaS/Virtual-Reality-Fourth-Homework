# Virtual-Reality-Fourth-Homework

### On the following link, you can find my Virtual Reality fourth homework: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XfrPg-FeHX0UYD7_FhFltW2Mob_jYFUX/view?usp=sharing
In this homework, I added three different interactions between the player and the virtual environment. The player can grab and push the purple ball if he is close enough. The player can teleport from one place to another by clicking on yellow rectangles, but he needs to be near the rectangle and wait for teleport to become enabled. Also, in the scene, there are brown bricks that rotate, and the player can change their way by clicking on them.
